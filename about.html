                <p> 
                    I am a full-time student aspiring to be a software developer, and 
                    I am pursuing my BS in computer science at CSU Fullerton. My 
                    coursework taught me skills covering data structures, databases, 
                    assembly language, algorithm engineering, software engineering, machine 
                    learning, and AI. I've also learned C++, Java, and some Python. As I'm 
                    still continuously learning&mdash;from my errors and successes&mdash;I'll 
                    only gain more skills and use my knowledge to fulfill the tasks given to me. 
                </p> <br> 
                <p>
                    From projects, I've learned that despite my struggles, I always feel pride 
                    and great satisfaction with my work. I realized that the most enjoyable projects 
                    were when I had to create innovative products. I enjoy getting into the head-space 
                    of a user to see how they think because I like seeing how my work will reflect what 
                    users want and more.
